## Overview
This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**-based legal chatbot designed to assist individuals in navigating the complexities of the Indian justice system. The chatbot leverages a **large language model (LLM)** enriched with comprehensive legal knowledge, including **all Indian court cases, penal codes, and law textbooks**. The goal is to empower individuals by providing them with **clear, structured guidance** when dealing with legal issues, helping them make informed decisions without unnecessary legal hurdles.

## Objectives
- Provide **easy-to-understand legal assistance** for common legal issues.
- Offer step-by-step guidance for users facing legal troubles.
- Reduce dependence on expensive legal consultations for preliminary queries.
- Help users understand their **rights, laws, and judicial processes**.
- Ensure accessibility to legal knowledge for everyone.

## Tech Stack
- **Vector Store**: FAISS
- **LLM**: Hugging Face's Mistral
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python
